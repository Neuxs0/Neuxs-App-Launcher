# About the game

This game is just a first person shooter that I decided to make in my free time. It's my first time making an actual game so don't expect it to be amazing.

# Updates

I won't be updating the game consistently and it's just me and im still learning to code to updates will take longer to come out.

# When the game gets too large

What I mean by "too large" is when the files are too large to upload to github. I will be moving the game to a website which i am hoping to be (gamename).cf.

# Who is working on this?

Currently I'm the only person working on this, Neuxs.
