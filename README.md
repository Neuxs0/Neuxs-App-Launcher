# Making game copies

When making software/app copies please make sure you read the license and use credit to me.

# Updates

I won't be updating the games/apps consistently and it's just me and im still learning to code to updates will take longer to come out.

# When the launcher gets too large

What I mean by "too large" is when the files are too large to upload to github. I will be moving the launcher to a website which i am hoping to be neuxsdev.cf. Once that happens, I most likely will abondon this github page, mabey deleting the repo.

# Who is working on this game?

Currently I'm the only person working on this, Neuxs.

# How do I trust this is safe and not a virus?

In this site, you can see all the code included in this app. If you can't tell what code is dangerous or not, you could have somebody who can check the code.
