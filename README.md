# About the game

This game is just a first person shooter that I decided to make in my free time. It's my first time making an actual game so don't expect it to be amazing.

# Updates

I won't be updating the game consistently, it's just me and im still learning to code, so updates will take longer to come out.

# Who is working on this?

Currently I'm the only person working on this, Neuxs.

# How do i trust this is safe and not a virus?

In this site, you can see all the code included in this all of these games/apps. If you can't tell what code is dangerous or not, you could have somebody who can check the code.
